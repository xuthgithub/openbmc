# From ADM1278 datasheet Rev. B page.40 formula (1), (2) and page.41 Table.12,
# power and current value are related to Rsense value.
# Driver use 1 milliohms for Rsense for power and current calculation.
# We need to multiply a value for calibration here.
#
# In kernel version 4.1.x -
# pmbus_core.c use milliwatt for direct format power output,
# so we need to multiply power output by 1000.
# In higher kernel version -
# pmbus_core.c use microwatt for direct format power output,
# so we need to multiply power output by 1.
